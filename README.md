# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created as a reference for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. The notes are separated by topic so that specific details are easier for users to locate and acts as an encompassing notes hub for students. This project used the newly acquired HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScipt skiils that were learned in the boot camp Prework.
